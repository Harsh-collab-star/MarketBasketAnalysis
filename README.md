## üìä Visualization Objectives
1. **Identify** top-performing products
2. **Discover** hidden purchase patterns
3. **Recommend** strategic product placements
4. **Optimize** promotional bundles

## ÔøΩ Chart Selection Rationale 

| Visualization | Purpose | Insight Generated |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Horizontal Bar Chart | Compare product frequencies | Identified top 20% products driving 80% sales |
| Network Graph | Reveal product relationships | Detected 3 strong cross-purchase clusters |
| Scatter Plot | Evaluate rule quality | Found 15 high-lift (>3) rules with >50% confidence |
| Sunburst Chart | Show category composition | Revealed Beverages account for 42% of sales |

## ‚ú® Aesthetics & Clarity
**Design Choices:**
- **Color Scheme:** Sequential blues/reds for quantitative data, categorical for products
- **Typography:** Open Sans font family for readability
- **Layout:** Grid-based dashboard with consistent margins
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to desktop/tablet viewing

**Best Practices Implemented:**
‚úîÔ∏è Axis labels with units  
‚úîÔ∏è Legend positioning top-right  
‚úîÔ∏è Contrast ratio >4.5:1 for accessibility  
‚úîÔ∏è Mobile-optimized figure sizes

## üìñ Data Storytelling 
### Key Narrative Points:
1. **The 80/20 Rule**  
   ![Market Basket Analysis](notebooks/outputs/visuals/20sales.png)  
   *"Just 15 products account for 82% of all transactions"*

2. **Power Couples**  
   ![Market Basket Analysis](notebooks/outputs/visuals/associations.png)  
   *"Customers who buy ground coffee are 4.2x more likely to add chocolate biscuits"*

3. **Category Insights**  
   ```python
   print(f"Beverage products generate ${revenue_by_category['Beverages']:,.2f} weekly")
